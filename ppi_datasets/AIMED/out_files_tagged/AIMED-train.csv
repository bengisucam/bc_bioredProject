These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar [PROTEIN1] RBP [/PROTEIN1]:[PROTEIN2] TTR [/PROTEIN2] ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.
